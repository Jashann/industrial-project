**Specifications for Traffic Control Devices**

Many of the temporary traffic control devices and guidelines that apply to construction and maintenance activities in Winnipeg are included in the fifth edition of the Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Canada \(MUTCDC\), published by the Transportation Association of Canada, 2323 St. Laurent Boulevard, Ottawa, Ontario, K1G 4J8. Signs and other traffic control devices that are legal for use on streets in The City of Winnipeg for temporary traffic control are authorized for use through their inclusion in Manitoba Regulation 264/88, 300/89, 145/2014, and 13/2019. ***It is illegal to use signs ***

***within the City’s public right-of-ways that are not approved in these Manitoba Regulations. *** 

Full-scale drawings of all traffic signs described in this Manual are available from The City of Winnipeg Public Works Department, Engineering Division, at 1155 Pacific Avenue. 

The design, including colour and dimensions, of all traffic control signs and other devices utilized must conform to the specifications set out in Section 5.02. It should be noted that these dimensions are minimums and in some cases larger signs may be required. As of January 1, 2012, all retroreflective sheeting on temporary traffic control signs, barricades and devices must use a minimum Type VIII retroreflective sheeting, with the exception of reboundable devices specifically channelization barrels, tall cones and traffic cones which shall use a minimum Type IV retroreflective sheeting \(ASTM D4956\). 

Under no circumstances are hand painted lettering, diagrams, or symbols permitted. 

**1�06 **

**Information Seminars**

The Public Works Department has created an online information seminar that reviews the requirements outlined in this Manual. It can be viewed online \(https://winnipeg.ca/publicworks/trafficControl/

manual-temporary-traffic-control.stm\). For more information contact the Traffic Management Branch 

at PWDLaneClosures@winnipeg.ca

**1�07 **

**Enforcement**

The Highway Traffic Act of the Province of Manitoba assigns to The City of Winnipeg the authority to regulate traffic movement on public streets under its jurisdiction. In turn, The City of Winnipeg’s Traffic By-law No. 1573/77 and Streets By-law No. 1481/77 mandates the use of this *Manual of* *Temporary* *Traffic Control on City Streets *\(Manual\) and the devices contained herein for use in work areas on City streets. 

Requirements identified in this Manual are subject to enforcement by City of Winnipeg Operations Constables. Violations of these requirements may be subject to the issuance of stop work orders and/or fines as indicated in The City of Winnipeg Streets By-Law 1481/77 \(Schedule “H”\). These infractions are enforced under the Municipal By-Law Enforcement Act and the Provincial Offence Act. 

The Operations Constable can be contacted by email at PWDEnforcement@winnipeg.ca

A Construction Agency can request designation as an Authorized Construction Agency from the Traffic Management Branch; this is requested in the Lane Closure App for each lane closure request. 

As an Authorized Construction Agency, they can perform many of the tasks previously required to be completed by the Traffic Services Branch, including installing regulatory signage, full or directional closures of Regional Streets, and Designated Construction Zones. Section 2.04 lists responsibilities of the Traffic Services Branch that can be adopted by Authorized Construction Agencies. 

The Traffic Management Branch will review a temporary traffic control plan including all temporary traffic control submitted by a Construction Agency, and upon review, the Branch may authorize the Construction Agency to set up and maintain the approved temporary traffic control plan. The Authorized Construction Agency permissions relate only to the project in which they are granted. 

Installing Designated Construction Zones, removing parking, and modifying existing traffic control signs requires additional documentation and record keeping processes.

The Traffic Management Branch can be contacted online through the Lane Closure Application 

\(https://laneclosures.winnipeg.ca\) if a lane closure request has been submitted, or via email at 

PWDLaneClosures@winnipeg.ca for general questions. The Traffic Management Branch is responsible for:

• Approving the time frame for all long term lane closures. 

• Reviewing proposed temporary traffic control plans and approving in consultation with the Traffic Services Branch. 

• Determining advance information sign requirements. 

• Authorizing turn restrictions. 

• Authorizing temporary posted speed limit reductions.

***2.02.01 Lane, Sidewalk, and Bike Facility Closures***

All requests for closures of traffic lanes, back lanes, bike facilities, or sidewalks must be submitted via the Lane Closure Application found at https://laneclosures.winnipeg.ca. The Traffic Management Branch reviews the request submission before approving the closure request. The approval process is to ensure that there are no conflicting projects, to provide public notice via the Streets/Sidewalk Closures website and/or media release, and to minimize the impact to the transportation system. 

Please review the lane closure notice requirements for the different types of lane closure requests in Section 2 *Responsibilities and Contacts*. 

To request a closure, the construction agency worker must create a user account on the application. 

Once the account is created, the user can access all of their current, pending, and completed lane closures. 

The closure request form collects the following information: 

• Description of activity

• Lane closure location and extent

• Number of lanes closed including sidewalks and/or bike lanes

• Description of temporary traffic control

• Any planned changes to the extent or configuration of the lane closures during the work

• Proposed start and end dates

• Other information depending on user selections when filling out the lane closure request Based on the details in the request, the impacted City users will be notified of the closure at time of approval and can access the closure details. These users include Winnipeg Transit, the Winnipeg Parking Authority, the Traffic Services Branch, the Traffic Signals Branch, and the Use of Streets permit desk, among others. All communication to these groups must occur in the lane closure app.

***2.02.02 Regional Street Lane Closures on Weekends, Public Holidays or at Night***

Many Regional Streets operate at or above capacity in at least one direction during either or both of the weekday peak periods, 07:00-09:00 and 15:00-18:00, Monday to Friday. Any lane closures during these periods can significantly increase congestion and delay, negatively impacting the public. 

Congestion and delay on Regional Streets is of particular concern in the vicinity of river crossings and on streets with limited access where alternative routes are not readily available. 

The following motion was approved by Council on September 27, 2012: 

*“That where it is deemed necessary by the Director of Public Works or their designate *

*\[Traffic Management Branch\], contractors \[Construction Agencies\] doing work on* *Regional Streets for private customers be required to do all things necessary to* *expedite completion of the work, including pavement restoration, through the use of* *24 hour and weekend work activities and steel plating of excavations during the a.m. *

*and/or p.m. peak rush hour periods.” *

Under certain circumstances, as required by the above motion, it may be necessary to undertake non-emergency work during weekends, night time hours \(between 18:00 and 07:00\), or on a public holiday. Such a requirement would normally occur only where the work would cause significant disruption to vehicular or pedestrian traffic during normal working hours as identified by the Traffic Management Branch. 

Non-Regional Streets are less likely to require restrictions on work during peak hours, however, the Traffic Management Branch reserves to right to implement peak hour restrictions as needed. 

***2.02.03 Authorizing Regulatory Signs and Optional Designated Construction Zones***

The following requests require approval by the Traffic Management Branch:

• Requests for temporary turn restrictions, yield or stop signs. 

• Temporary posted speed limit reductions. 

• Optional Designated Construction Zones. 

Specific details on the requirements for temporary posted speed limit reductions and optional Designated Construction Zones can be found in Section 3.04 and Section 3.05.01, respectively. 

**2�03 **

**Public Works Permits**

The Public Works Department is responsible for issuing the following permits:

• Use of Street Permits – PWD-UOS-Permits@winnipeg.ca

◦ All activities that impede or temporarily occupy the right-of-way. 

• Crossing Permits on Regional Streets – PWD-UOS-Permits@winnipeg.ca

◦ At any time an applicant requires to cross a curb, boulevard or sidewalk, other than a private approach, with a vehicle trailer, or any piece of equipement. 

• Street Excavation Cut Permits – \(204\) 986-3184

◦ For any excavation in or under a road, sidewalk or boulevard. 

Questions regarding other permits should be directed to 311.

**Public Works Traffic Services Branch**

The Traffic Services Branch is responsible for: 

• Providing guidance in selecting the appropriate temporary traffic control and work zone schemes. 

• Attending a preconstruction meeting for City of Winnipeg Capital Projects to advise as to traffic control requirements and provide input during construction as required. 

The following responsibilities can also be performed by an Authorized Construction Agency permitted by the Traffic Management Branch. 

• Placing and maintaining all regulatory signs and traffic control devices authorized by the Traffic Management Branch, with the exception of the ‘KEEP RIGHT/KEEP LEFT’ sign \(RB-25 / RB-25L\) which may be installed by the Construction Agency. Common examples include parking restrictions, stopping restrictions, turn restrictions and diamond lane removal. 

• Placing, maintaining and removing regulatory, guidance and information signs for traffic control purposes in the following situations:

a. Full or directional closures on a Regional Street. 

b. Traffic routed across a median on a divided street. 

c. Traffic reversals where the direction of travel in a lane is reversed, at Traffic Management’s discretion. 

d. Full closure of a non-regional street where the requirements for regulatory signs \(turn restrictions, bus stop relocations, etc.\) to implement the closure is significant. 

• Where a Designated Construction Zone has been approved, Traffic Services will be responsible for placing all of the advance signs and ‘Construction Ends’ \(TC-4\) signs, and removing upon completion. In the above instances, the Construction Agency is still responsible for all other temporary traffic control within the Designated Construction Zone, including but not limited to barricades, barrels and tall cones. Please refer to Section 3.04 for Designated Construction Zone requirements. 

For parking removal requests, **at least three \(3\) business days’ notice** is required. However, for more extensive installation requests including full closures, directional closures, median crossings, and Designated Construction Zones with or without temporary posted speed limit reductions, **at least** **two \(2\) weeks’ notice** is requested. Please provide a billing address along with contact information when making requests. 

**2�05 **

**Winnipeg Parking Authority**

When the work zone affects on-street paid parking or requires temporary removal of the paystation\(s\), the Winnipeg Parking Authority \(WPA\) will be alerted to the lane closure approval. WPA can temporarily remove paystations for construction, and later restore normal operations when notified. Removal of on-street paid parking and/or temporary removal/reinstallation of paystation\(s\) will be invoiced based on the WPA fees and charges schedule. 

When a lane closure request is approved, the Winnipeg Parking Authority is automatically alerted when their services are to be impacted. They will be able to access lane closure details on the lane closure application and reach out to the construction agency with any concerns.

**Public Works Traffic Signals Branch**

If a lane closure request affects traffic signals or a pedestrian corridor, the contractor needs to select 

“Traffic Signals Affected” when filling out the request; this will automatically add the Traffic Signals Branch to the lane closure request. The contractor is responsible for coordinating the Traffic Signals work via the Lane Closure App messaging feature. The Traffic Signals Branch requires at least three \(3\) business days’ notice for both modifying and reopening the signal infrastructure. 

***2.06.01 Restricting Left-Turns***

Where turning is restricted, as authorized by Traffic Management, the corresponding turn signal head, if present, needs to be covered or disabled by the Traffic Signals Branch. Any turn restriction signs would still be placed by the Traffic Services Branch or an Authorized Construction Agency. 

***2.06.02 Advance Warning Flashers in Temporary Reduced Speed Areas***

Advanced warning flashers must be covered by the Traffic Signals Branch when located within the limits of a reduced speed zone. 

***2.06.03 Closure of Pedestrian Crossing Facilities***

A pedestrian crossing facility closure \(e.g. closure of a signalized pedestrian crossing, pedestrian corridor with overhead flashing beacons or rectangular rapid flashing beacons \(RRFBs\), or an unsignalized crosswalk\) is required anytime there are accessibility concerns and the crossing is no longer safe for public use. A pedestrian crossing facility could be unsafe to cross because of an open excavation, active construction equipment, curing concrete, or many other reasons. Use the following flow chart to determine the appropriate closure type and then review the corresponding closure requirements.

Managed Partial Closure of a Signalized Crosswalk

A site personnel managed partial crosswalk closure is acceptable if a signalized crosswalk or pedestrian corridor \(both facility types hereby referred to in this subsection as a signalized crossing\) for a short-term crosswalk on an active construction site where the closure is **less than one day and** **the crossing is not left unattended**. A signalized crosswalk closure on consecutive days would be considered a full crosswalk closure \(see *Full Closure of a Signalized Crosswalk* below\). 

A partial crosswalk closure consists of a barricade with a lower barrier and a sidewalk closed sign \(TC-76\) at both ends of the crosswalk \(see figure below\) with workers present to assist pedestrians when required. All signalized pedestrian crossing infrastructure will remain active. This type of crosswalk closure provides flexibility for the contractor to do short duration closures when workers are present without needing to provide notice to the Traffic Signals Branch. 

A signalized crossing with a partial crosswalk closure should be reopened as soon as it is safe to do so and should not remain closed if the accessibility concerns are no longer present.

Full Closure of a Signalized Crosswalk

A full crosswalk closure is required for a signalized crosswalk or pedestrian corridor \(both facility types hereby referred to in this subsection as a signalized crossing\) that is not safe to cross for **longer** **than one day** and/or where **the crossing will be unattended for any length of time**. 

There are two components to a full signalized crosswalk closure, both of which **must** be completed for the crosswalk to be considered fully closed \(figure on the following page\):

• Installation of a barricade with a lower barrier with a sidewalk closed sign \(TC-76\) at both ends of the crosswalk \(contractor responsibility\); and

• Disable the signalized pedestrian crossing infrastructure \(must be completed by the Traffic Signals Branch, contractor to coordinate\).

Note: Vehicle lane temporary traffic control not shown

To coordinate the work, the contractor is responsible for notifying the Traffic Signals Branch via the City’s lane closure application **at least three \(3\) business days before the full crosswalk closure**. 

When requesting the lane closure, the requestor must select and complete the Traffic Signal Altered section. 

The traffic signals infrastructure work conducted by the Traffic Signals Branch will be determined by the Traffic Signals crews. The work may include but is not limited to bagging the pedestrian signal heads or corridor boxes, disabling audible pedestrian signals \(APS\), disabling pushbuttons, and installing pedestrian prohibited signs \(RB-66\). 

A fully closed signalized crossing should be reopened if accessibility concerns are no longer present, the signalized crossing can be reopened safely, and if feasible based on the construction sequencing. 

The contractor is responsible for notifying the Traffic Signals Branch via the City’s lane closure application **at least three \(3\) business days before the crosswalk is reopened** and must coordinate the removal of the barricades with the traffic signals work. The contractor must take all reasonable measures to minimize the duration of the signalized crossing closure; a crossing remaining closed due to poor scheduling or communication by the contractor is not acceptable. 

Unsignalized Crosswalk Closure

An unsignalized crossing facility is required to be closed when it is unsafe to cross for any length of time. An unsignalized crossing includes a signed crosswalk at an unsignalized location, including both a pedestrian crossings at a stop controlled intersection or any location where a pedestrian may be guided onto the street by pedestrian infrastructure/signage. 

An unsignalized crossing closure consists of the installation of a barricade with lower barrier and a sidewalk closed sign \(TC-76\) at both ends of the crosswalk \(figure on the following page\). This type of closure is the responsibility of the contractor upon approval in the lane closure application. As there is no signalized component, no notification of the Traffic Signals Branch is required.

**Component Areas of a Construction Zone**

A construction zone encompasses the entire length of the construction project limits and may include one or multiple work zones. In general, to provide motorists, cyclists and pedestrians with sufficient information to safely and effectively pass through or around a work zone, there are four distinct areas in a work zone, as shown in the following illustration:

• Advance Warning Area

• Transition Area

• Activity Area

• Termination Area

Advance Warning Area

The advance warning area alerts motorists of road work ahead and provides time and distance to adjust to changes in road conditions prior to reaching them. This may vary from a single traffic control device to a series of traffic control devices. 

Transition Area

In the transition area, the motorist is directed from their normal path to a new path around the work area. Work materials, vehicles, and equipment should not be stored or parked in this area. The transition area must be obvious and the intended path must be clearly delineated so that road users will not mistakenly follow the wrong path. 

Activity Area

The activity area is the portion of roadway closed to traffic and is reserved for the exclusive use of workers, equipment and material storage. The activity area may be a fixed location or may move as the work progresses. The activity area includes the longitudinal buffer space, the work area, the traffic space, and the lateral buffer space:

a. Longitudinal buffer space provides protection for traffic and workers between the end of the taper area and the work area. 

b. Work area is reserved for workers, equipment and material storage. 

c. Traffic space allows traffic to pass through the activity area. 

d. Lateral buffer provides for a separation between the work area and the adjacent traffic space. 

As indicated in the MUTCDC Fifth Edition Part D – Temporary Conditions, Section D4.2.2; it may not be possible to provide longitudinal buffer space in urban areas due to space restrictions. However, should the situation allow, a longitudinal buffer space is recommended. 

Termination Area

The termination area allows motorists to transition back to the normal travel path and travel speed. 

The termination area extends from the end of the work area to the point where traffic is able to resume normal driving. A downstream taper is provided to allow vehicles to move back into the closed lane\(s\). The termination area is optional in most situations but is required in a two-lane shift scenario 

\(Figures 2, 5, 6, and 8a\) only.

**3�03 **

**Duration of Work**

This manual provides three work duration categories:

• Long term; 

• Short term; and 

• Mobile / Very short term. 

Each has its own temporary traffic control requirements, as outlined below. 

***3.03.01 Long Term Work Zones***

*\(Closure for more than 2 hours\)*

Use of long term sign setups, as shown in Figures 1a through 32 in Section 5.04, is required if the closure exceeds 2 hours. 

Due to the height of the signs and the directionality, chevrons are useful for some situations and may still be used in place of channelization barrels \(see Figure 1b\). Channelization barrels, as shown in Section 5.02.02, are preferred over the use of chevrons. Similarly, tall cones are preferred over the use of construction markers in long term sign setups. Note that traffic cones are not permitted in long term sign setups. 

***3.03.02 Short Term Work Zones***

*\(Closure greater than 30 minutes and up to 2 hours\)*

Closures that are in place for a period greater than 30 minutes but less than 2 hours may use a modified signing approach, as shown in Section 5.04 Figures 33 to 40, if the closure meets the following guidelines:

• The closure shall not exceed 2 hours duration. 

• No more than two lanes are closed at any one time and there must be at least one other traffic lane available for that direction of travel. 

• The closure must be supplemented with advance warning signs TC-2 \(Roadwork\) and TC-5 

\(Temporary Lane Closed Ahead\) or WD-17 \(Double Arrow\) when used on streets with 70, 80 

or 90 km/h posted speed limits. Use of a flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device is recommended on these higher speed limit streets. 

• Where visibility of the work zone is limited by a horizontal curve, the closure must be set up 100 m in advance of the horizontal curve and a line of traffic cones shall be extended around the horizontal curve to the work area. 

• Where visibility of the work zone is limited by a vertical curve, the beginning of the short term sign setup must occur on the level section of road prior to the start of the vertical curve and be carried through to the work area. 

• The closure may not be used at night during hours of darkness without written consent from the Traffic Management Branch \(PWDLaneClosures@winnipeg.ca\). Use of a flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device is required for any work at night. Closures that do not meet the above noted guidelines must be signed as a long term work zone. 

CITY OF WINNIPEG

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 17 -**

***3.03.03 Mobile and Very Short Duration Work Zones***

*\(Work zones that move continuously or intermittently, stopping at a fixed location for up to* *30 minutes\)*

For mobile and very short duration work zones, the time required to set up and remove extensive sign setups can exceed the time required to perform the work. Therefore, flashing beacons, arrow boards, variable message signs, and buffer vehicles are to be used to provide adequate traffic control, minimize exposure of workers to traffic and ensure that work is completed in a timely manner. Setups described in Section 5.04 Figure 41, can be used for mobile and very short duration work zones if the work zone meets the following guidelines:

• The closure shall not exceed 30 minutes duration. 

• Mobile and very short duration work zones are not permitted on Regional Streets during weekday peak periods. 

• Only one lane is closed at any one time and there must be at least one other lane available for that direction of travel. 

• A buffer vehicle equipped with a flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device must be used where visibility of the work zone is limited by horizontal or vertical curves \(examples: bridges, overpasses or underpasses\). The buffer vehicle should be located at the most visible location available. 

• On streets with a posted speed limit of 70, 80 or 90 km/h, a flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device is required. 

• A flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device is required at night. 

Truck or trailer mounted impact attenuators \(also known as crash cushions\) are recommended at the beginning of a mobile or very short duration closure on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 70 

km/h or higher. 

***3.03.04 Survey Crew Work Zones***

Survey crew work zones can stretch over long distances and the nature of the work often requires a crew to take measurements at several points along the cross section of a right of way. Additional temporary traffic control measures are to be used in comparison to mobile and very short duration work zones. The setup described in Section 5.04 Figure 42, can be used for survey crew work zones if the work zone meets the following guidelines:

• Survey crew work zones are not permitted on Regional Streets during weekday peak periods. 

• Only one lane is closed at any one time and there must be at least one other lane available for that direction of travel. 

• A buffer vehicle equipped with flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device must be used. 

• Survey crew must be visible from the survey crew signage. 

• The closure may not be used at night during hours of darkness without written consent from the Traffic Management Branch PWDLaneClosures@winnipeg.ca. 

• A DCZ with a reduced speed of 60 km/h or lower must be used if the posted speed limit is greater than 60 km/h. 

Closures that do not meet the above noted guidelines must be signed using mobile, short term, or long term setups.

**Designated Construction Zones**

In December 2013, the Government of Manitoba passed Highway Traffic Act \(HTA\) amendments intended to double the set fines for speeding in a Designated Construction Zone \(DCZ\). The amendments authorize double fines for speeding:

• Whether or not there are workers/equipment present; and

• Whether or not there is a reduction in the maximum speed within the DCZ. 

The amendments require construction agencies to establish DCZs in some circumstances and allow for optional use of DCZs in other circumstances. Wherever DCZs are established they must be identified using the signage prescribed in the Provincial Designated Construction Zones Regulation 145/2014. 

The DCZ requirements were implemented on May 16, 2014. Traffic authorities, or Construction Agencies working on their behalf, are responsible to establish DCZs and to identify them in accordance with the regulation. Note that posted speed limits remain unchanged when a DCZ is established unless authorized as described in the following sections. 

***3.04.01 Roadwork Conditions that Require a Designated Construction Zone***

A Construction Agency must set up a work zone as a DCZ if the work being undertaken on a road meets **ALL** of the following conditions: 

1. Work is on the roadway portion of a street, i.e. the area of a street where vehicles travel, this does not include the shoulder, sidewalk or ditch/median; 

2. Work is 4 hours or more in duration; 

3. Work is on a paved roadway; and

4. Work is on a roadway where the maximum posted speed is 80 km/h or more. 

If one or more of the above conditions does not apply to the work being undertaken, then the Construction Agency is not * * required to establish a DCZ. For example, a Construction Agency is not required to establish a DCZ if the work is taking place on a gravel road; or on a road where the regular maximum speed is 50 km/h; or when the work is on the shoulder/sidewalk. 

The Traffic Services Branch or a Construction Agency authorized by the Traffic Management Branch are the only agencies permitted to set up and remove DCZ signs. The Construction Agency is responsible for the signage within the DCZ. To request a DCZ, the Construction Agency must submit a lane closure request for Traffic Management approval at https://laneclosures.winnipeg.ca at least two \(2\) weeks ahead of the closure. Submitting a lane closure request for a DCZ requires the following actions and information:

• selecting “Designated Construction Zone \(DCZ\)” under the Authorized Construction Agency section; 

• selecting the speed limit in the proposed work zone section; 

• a description of the construction limits and if they will change as the work progresses; 

• confirmation if the temporary traffic control will be removed at the end of each day; 

• a description of the physical hazards present to motorists when workers are not present; 

• a description of the typical hours of work; and

• attaching a digital to-scale drawing of the temporary traffic control plan to the lane closure request after submission. 

CITY OF WINNIPEG

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 19 -**

***3.04.02 Optional Designated Construction Zone***

When roadwork conditions do not meet the criteria for a required DCZ, the Construction Agency may request an optional DCZ. To request a DCZ, the Construction Agency must submit a lane closure request for Traffic Management approval at https://laneclosures.winnipeg.ca at least two \(2\) weeks ahead of the closure. Further details on the submission of a DCZ lane closure request are in Section 

3.04.01. To be considered as an optional DCZ, the work being undertaken must be road construction, reconstruction, widening, improvement, repair, or other similar work in relation to the road. 

***3.04.03 Designated Construction Zone Sign Setup***

The following diagram shows the basic DCZ sign setup with an associated reduction in maximum speed. This setup also applies where the maximum speed is not reduced but flagpersons and appropriate associated signs \(as detailed in Section 3.06\) are used to slow traffic. 

The City of Winnipeg Traffic Management Branch may reduce the maximum speed in all or part\(s\) of a DCZ if it meets the requirements set out in Section 3.05.01 of this Manual. In these cases, The City of Winnipeg Traffic Services Branch or a Construction Agency authorized by the Traffic Management Branch is responsible for erecting/placing all associated DCZ signs in accordance with the regulation, as well as any speed limit signs. Please refer to Section 3.04.01 to request an optional DCZ and/or posted speed limit reduction. 

DCZ and reduced speed signs are to be installed on both sides of the road on a one-way roadway and on the right side and median of divided roadways. Where medians are not wide enough for sign installation, signs can be placed only on the right side of the roadway. 

The Traffic Services Branch or Authorized Construction Agency is responsible to erect/place signs identifying the beginning and end of a DCZ in accordance with the regulation, as follows: a. ‘Designated Construction Zone’ Sign:

On the roadway under construction, the beginning of a DCZ must be identified with the 

‘Designated Construction Zone’ \(MC-1D\) sign \(minimum size 900 mm x 900 mm\). This sign is used in place of the ‘Roadwork’ \(TC-2\) sign indicated elsewhere in this manual. It is recommended to install ‘Designated Construction Zone’ signs along the turning lanes on side streets entering a DCZ.

***3.04.04 Zipper Merge Signage***

The zipper merge strategy, also known as a late merge, is effective when there are high traffic volumes and low speeds. This strategy directs drivers to remain in the upcoming closed lane until they reach a designated merge point. Upon reaching the merge point, they will merge with drivers in the open lane in an alternating pattern. The benefits of a late merge strategy include a reduction in travel time as the merging is in a consistent pattern and shorter queue lengths upstream of the closure as the queue is equally shared by two lanes. 

Zipper merge signs are required in a work zone when all of the following criteria are met:

• The normal posted speed is 80 km/h or greater

• The duration of work is two \(2\) days or longer

• The work zone reduces two \(2\) lanes to one \(1\)

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 23 -**

With the prohibition of the ‘MAXIMUM 60 WHEN PASSING WORKERS’ sign there are currently three options in The City of Winnipeg available to explicitly control speeds in construction zones:

• Full Time Reduced Speed Limits with or without DCZs

• Daily Shift Reduced Speed Limits with DCZs 

• Flagpersons equipped with ‘SLOW’ paddles

Any posted reduction in speed limit in a construction zone, both full time and daily shift, must be approved and authorized by the Traffic Management Branch. The Traffic Management Branch may issue a work order to the Traffic Services Branch or provide permission to a Construction Agency to install any speed reductions. 

*Note: For work zones without a posted speed limit reduction but where photo enforcement of the* *posted speed limit is desired, a ‘Construction Ends’ \(TC-4\) sign must be placed at the end of the work* *zone as per Section 11\(1\)\(b\) of Manitoba Regulation 220/2002. *

To request a DCZ with speed reduction, the Construction Agency must submit a lane closure request for Traffic Management approval at https://laneclosures.winnipeg.ca at least two \(2\) weeks ahead of the closure. Further details on the submission of a DCZ lane closure request are in Section 3.04.01

If advanced warning flashers are located within the limits of the speed reduction, the advanced warning flashers must be covered by the Traffic Services Branch. 

Temporary rumble strips can be installed as part of a reduced speed zone to increase driver alertness. 

Temporary rumble strips are further explained in Section 5.02.08. 

***3.05.01 Reduced Speed Signage***

Reduced Maximum Speed signs \(RB-1\) are to be installed after each intersection. The Maximum Speed Ahead sign \(WB-9\), all Maximum Speed signs for the reduced speed limit, and the first Maximum Speed sign of the original speed limit after the reduced speed zone require warning flags above each sign. 

***3.05.02 Full Time Reduced Speed Limits***

Full time reduced speed limits, i.e. speed limits reduced to 50 or 60 km/h posted 24 hours a day, are generally limited to construction projects with full time lane closures on streets with speed limits of 60, 70, 80 or 90 km/h. Factors considered in determining if a full time reduced speed limit is warranted include:

• Restrictive road geometry resulting from detours, diversions, crossovers or narrow lanes; 

• Proximity and exposure of workers to open traffic lanes; 

• Proximity of hazards such as pavement edge drop-offs to open traffic lanes; 

• Length of construction zone. 

CITY OF WINNIPEG

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 24 -**

***3.05.03 Daily Shift Reduced Speed Limits***

Daily shift reduced speed limits can be used in conjunction with DCZs when full time reduced speed limits are not warranted. The posted reduction in speed limit is set up and removed daily by the Traffic Services Branch or an Authorized Construction Agency prior to work commencing and after work has been completed for the day. These projects generally do not have full time lane closures or any hazards in the work zone when workers are not present. 

***3.05.04 Flagging***

In circumstances where a full time or a daily shift reduced speed limit is not warranted, and there is a desire to control speed through the construction zone, the Construction Agency can employ flagpersons equipped with ‘SLOW’ paddles on the approaches to the work area. Further details on flagging are presented in Section 3.06. 

**3�06 **

**Flagperson Practices**

Flagpersons are used when it is necessary to stop and direct approaching motorists or to stop them momentarily. Flagpersons can also be used to signal motorists to reduce speed through a work zone. 

In all circumstances, the flagperson must be able to communicate effectively. To be effective, the flagperson must be kept aware of the changing conditions in the work zone so that he/she is able to communicate with the motorist respecting:

a. The road conditions ahead; 

b. The path to follow; 

c. When the potential for interaction between workers and traffic exists; and d. When the approach sight distance to the work area is limited. 

‘FLAGPERSON AHEAD’ signs \(MC-64\) as illustrated in Section 5.02 shall be placed between 90 m and 120 m in advance of the flagperson \(see Figure 18\) who must be equipped with flagperson’s tools as described in Section 5.02.08. In the majority of work zones, the flagperson shall be stationed 60 

m in advance of the work area or start of taper. Flagpersons must always be visible to motorists from a distance of at least 150 m. 

When flagpersons are not present, the ‘FLAGPERSON AHEAD’ sign\(s\) must be removed or hidden from the motorists’ view. 

All flagpersons must have completed a Flagperson Training Course and carry with them a training certificate at all times. Training material, including the Flagperson Training Workbook, is available from Manitoba Infrastructure. A list of training providers can be found on the Safe Work Manitoba website \(www.safemanitoba.com\). Furthermore, all flagpersons must adhere to the regulations of the Workplace Safety and Health M.R. 217/2006 and The Highway Traffic Act.

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 25 -**

**3�07 **

**Work Zone Considerations**

***3.07.01 Pedestrian and Bicycle Travel***

Reasonable efforts must be made to refrain from closing bicycle facilities and sidewalks. Different streets provide different levels of accomodation for cyclists. Closing a segment of the City’s bike network is frequently more harmful than closing a street or lane to motorized traffic due to the lack of safe and accessible alternate routes. It is important to indicate on lane closure requests when bicycle facilities are being closed. 

The temporary traffic control chosen for the closure of an active transportation facility should match the level of safety provided by the facility that is being closed. For example, when closing a protected bike lane, it is expected that the adjacent travel lane be closed and used as a bike detour around the work area. This is particularly important for one-way streets with bi-directional bike lanes such as McDermot Avenue or Garry Street. Cyclists using the counter-flow direction of the bike lane are put in a dangerous situation when they come to a bike lane closure that forces them onto the sidewalk or into oncoming traffic. When applicable, on-street parking should be removed to facilitate safe travel for vehicles and cyclists. 

When there is no active work being completed on a sidewalk, the sidewalk should be restored to a point where it is safe and traversable using a sturdy, non-slip material. Small excavations in the pedestrian travel path can often be temporarily restored using packed granular that allows pedestrians to mount curbs and access crosswalks. 

New signs have been developed for sidewalk closures to be placed at the location of the closure and at adjacent crossings to indicate the need to cross the street. When travel lanes are too narrow for vehicles and bicycles to safely share the road, single file signs can be installed to direct drivers and cyclists to operate in a single file through a work zone. Share the lane and take the lane strategies are illustrated in Figures 22a and 22b. Signs for bicycle lane and sidewalk closures are shown in Section 

5.02.01. 

***3.07.02 Transit Stops and Transit Users***

Winnipeg Transit has the authority to determine the level of accomodation at bus stops in work zones. 

Bus stops may be closed, relocated out of, or maintained in a work zone. Figure 19 illustrates a typical temporary transit stop when loading and unloading from the second lane or median. 

When bus stops are to be maintained from the second lane due to work in the curb lane, precautions must be taken to ensure the safety of transit users and the accessibility of the stops. Barricades or pedestrian channelization devices must be used to separate the bus stop area from the active work areas, and temporary platforms must extend from the curb to the edge of the lane where transit will be loading and unloading. Prefabricated temporary bus platforms are available and provide simple products that snap together to form platforms of any size. 

When a work zone requires traffic to cross over a median and transit loading and unloading to take place on the median, a separated pedestrian path with curb ramps must be provided for accessibility. 

The area of the median used for loading must have non-slip surface. 

CITY OF WINNIPEG

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 26 -**

***3.07.03 Lateral and Vertical Position of Traffic Control Devices***

Traffic control devices must be well within the normal field of vision of the motorist to be effective. This is particularly necessary at night when motorists are not able to see the whole roadway environment and must depend upon the reflected light from traffic signs and other devices to provide the necessary information. Appropriate lateral and vertical placement of temporary signs helps to ensure that the necessary information is available. 

In general, motorists in urban areas travel with their headlights on low beams. Signs and other devices that are placed too low or high, or too far left or right, are not fully reflected. As a result, these types of traffic control devices located on the roadway, boulevard or shoulder should be:

• Between 0.3 m and 2.5 m from the edge of the travel lane; 

• Installed so that the bottom of the sign is no less than 1.5 m above the roadway or 1.0 m above the roadway for 900 mm x 900 m or larger signs; and

• Cleaned regularly. 

Signs on the boulevard should be placed in a location that does not obstruct the pedestrian or cyclist travel path. 

***3.07.04 Warning Flags***

As illustrated in Section 5.04, warning flags shall be installed on the first warning or temporary traffic control sign in a taper within a long term sign setup and on any portable sign used in a short term sign setup. The use of warning flags increases the visibility of the temporary traffic control devices that define obstructions on the roadway, thereby assisting motorists in selecting the proper traffic lane. 

Flags shall be:

• Red or orange in colour; 

• Shall be no less than 0.16 square metres; and

• Shall be placed so that the top of the flag is a minimum of 0.5 m above the top of the sign. 

***3.07.05 Traffic Lane Clearances***

A traffic lane on a major thoroughfare is normally about 3.5 m wide and in no case less than 3.0 m. When traffic lanes are open, these lane widths should remain clear of traffic control devices, construction materials and equipment. Placement of large objects close to the edge of a traffic lane effectively reduces the lane width. Material and equipment placed close to either side of a traffic lane should be avoided where possible, particularly on high speed \(70, 80 or 90 km/h\) routes. 

***3.07.06 Construction Equipment***

The location of equipment, material, construction vehicles, and personnel shelters within the work zone must not interfere with the ability of motorists, cyclists and pedestrians to see workers or traffic control devices. The movement of vehicles and equipment into and out of the work zone shall be undertaken with the least possible interference to traffic movements on the street. In many instances, a flagperson will be required for this purpose. **Parking of personal vehicles within the work zone** **is generally not permitted. **

CITY OF WINNIPEG

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 27 -**

**4 MAINTENANCE**

**4�01 **

**General**

It is the responsibility of the Construction Agency to inspect and undertake the necessary maintenance or replacement of traffic control signs, as well as all other devices, and to ensure that they are legible and in their proper place at all times. All signs and devices must be regularly reviewed to ensure that legibility and colour \(daytime or nighttime\) is approximately equivalent to new devices. 

For this purpose, reflectorized signs or devices will be deemed to be acceptable if they are clearly visible and legible when illuminated with normal vehicle lights on low beams from a distance of 100 

metres. Additionally, their general daytime condition should be such that they command respect. 

Damaged, defaced or dirty signs lose their authority as traffic control devices, and are a discredit to the Construction Agency responsible for them. 

Signs with conflicting messages must be removed from view. Obstructions such as shrubbery, construction materials or parked vehicles, must not obscure the visibility of temporary traffic control devices. **When devices are not required they must either be removed or hidden from the** **motorists’ view. **

***4.01.01 Work Area Enclosures***

It is the responsibility of the Construction Agency to safely enclose the work area when required, in accordance with the Workplace Safety and Health Regulation 217/2006. 

The work area must have a sign prominently identifying the name and emergency telephone number of the Construction Agency. 

Construction

Agency Name:

Emergency

Phone Number:

**4�02 **

**Removal of Traffic Control Devices**

Under Section 77\(9\) of The Highway Traffic Act, traffic control devices at a construction site must be removed when it is no longer necessary for the devices to remain in place. In some cases, a detour or street closure will be in effect only during certain hours of the day, in which case the affected section of street should be restored to normal use at other times. It is essential that all the devices which are not applicable when the street is restored to normal use be either removed or otherwise hidden from the motorists’ view. 

CITY OF WINNIPEG

MANUAL OF TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL ON CITY STREETS - 2022 EDITION REV 1

**- 28 -**

**5 TEMPORARY TRAFFIC CONTROL DEVICES AND ILLUSTRATIONS**

**5�01 **

**General**

The following sections detail the approved signs and devices required to implement the requirements of this Manual. Figures in Section 5.04 show typical traffic control details for many circumstances. 

Adjustments to traffic control may be required to suit site specific conditions. 

To be effective during hours of darkness, all signs, barricades, delineators, cones and other similar devices must be reflective. To optimize this reflectivity, these devices must be regularly cleaned and well maintained. As of January 1, 2012, all retroreflective sheeting on temporary traffic signs, barricades and devices must use a minimum Type VIII retroreflective sheeting, with the exception of reboundable devices specifically channelization barrels, tall cones and traffic cones which shall use a minimum Type IV retroreflective sheeting \(ASTM D4956\). 

Under no circumstances are signs with hand painted lettering, diagrams, or symbols permitted. 

Similarly, yellow or orange caution tape is not an approved traffic control device in this manual. The use of caution tape or non-approved signs is an illegal violation of the City’s Streets By-Law 1481/77 

and Traffic By-Law 1573/77, and is subject to prescribed fines. 

Construction Agencies are REQUIRED to provide contact information on the back of temporary traffic control devices to allow recovered property to be returned. Temporary traffic control devices without contact information may be removed by a City of Winnipeg Streets Constable.

**Traffic Control Devices**

This section describes the most commonly used traffic control devices for road work operations and other temporary conditions.

***5.02.03 Flashing or Sequential Arrow Traffic Control Devices \(Arrow Boards\)***

Construction Agencies are encouraged to use arrow boards to increase the visibility of a work zone. 

Arrow boards are specifically required for short term work at night, mobile and very short duration work zones at night and on streets with a speed limit of 70, 80 or 90 km/h, and survey crew work zones. However, arrow boards are also recommended for short term work on streets with a speed limit of 70, 80 or 90 km/h and as a supplement in any circumstance that requires higher than normal visibility \(nighttime, high speed, high traffic volumes\). 

Requirements for the arrow board devices are as follows:

1. Arrow boards shall be mounted on a vehicle or on a trailer so that they are clearly visible from the rear. The bottom edge of the device shall be a minimum of 1.5 m from ground level. 

2. The arrow board message should be distinguishable by an approaching motorist at a distance of at least 500 m on a sunny day. 

150 mm

3. The visibility of the arrow board to approaching motorists must

*Note: the use of a horizontal warning bar \(light stick\) is not an acceptable form of temporary traffic* *control on a Regional Street, unless used in a parking lane where the speed is 60 km/h or less. *

Figures in the Short Term, Mobile and Very Short Duration, and Survey Crew Work Zone sections illustrate the use of an arrow board.

***5.02.04 Variable Message Signs ***

Variable message signs \(VMS\) are generally used to warn motorists in advance of and during a project when significant traffic impacts are expected. VMS are often used for full closures, detours and significant lane closures on high volume routes. The use of VMS and the message displayed is to be specified by the Traffic Management Branch in consultation with the Traffic Services Branch. 

When VMS are unavailable, static information signs may be posted by the Traffic Services Branch as an alternative.

***5.02.05 Barricades ***

Barricades may be used in situations where it is necessary to close a road, street, lane or shoulder at, or in advance of, the work area; barricades are then placed at the start of, and end of the work zone. 

The enclosure of the work zone using barricades must ensure that motorists, cyclists and pedestrians are adequately advised of the boundaries of the work zone. When barricades are removed to allow access/egress from the work zone for vehicles or equipment, the barricades shall be replaced immediately after such access/egress has occurred. The use of barricades to form a wall alongside the work area \(parallel with traffic flow\) is strictly prohibited except in the case of curb repair work. 

Barricades should be used in long work zones with intermittent hazards. When a travel lane is closed for an extended distance for work such as concrete joint repairs, it is recommended to locate a barricade perpendicular to traffic at a spacing of every third delineation device or 27m in low speed environments. This serves as a reminder to motorists that the lane is closed when hazards are not visible. 

For long term pedestrian deviations in work zones, pedestrian channelization devices are preferred. 

The placement of barricades shall generally be in the manner indicated in the “Illustrations of Typical Situations” in Section 5.04. 

Device Requirements

All panels must have a minimum type VIII \(high intensity\) retroreflective sheeting and the barricade panel identified with \(“W” x “X”\) shall be vertically striped. The barricade frame may be constructed from metal, wood, or plastic material. 

The Agency’s name and telephone number **MUST** be clearly displayed on the barricade panel in the bottom right corner \(maximum size 450 mm wide and 120 mm high\). 

Barricades must conform to the following specifications:

**9� Road Closure Barricades for Non-Regional Streets**

When closing a road at a midblock location, barricades must be set up at each of the adjacent

intersections, on the intersection leg closest to the closure. At these soft closures where traffic 

≥3.05m

is still permitted to bypass the "W" 

≥582mm

barricades to access properties ahead of the work zone, a 

rectangular ‘ROAD CLOSED’ sign with a ‘NO EXIT’ tab should be attached to the center-most barricade. The ‘ROAD CLOSED’ sign is to be black on orange. At the edge of the work zone, the ‘NO EXIT’ tab is not required. This setup is shown in Section 5.04 Figure 29. 

The ‘ROAD CLOSED’ and ‘NO EXIT’ signs work similarly to previously used ‘LOCAL TRAFFIC 

ONLY’ signs, which are no longer permitted under this manual.

"L" 

Temporary barriers such as concrete barriers \(commonly referred to as jersey barriers\), steel barriers, 

≥ 2.75m

or ballast-filled barriers are used to prevent vehicles from encroaching into the work area. The placement of barriers must be parallel to the flow of traffic continuously without gaps. Leaving barrier ends exposed creates a hazard for errant motorists and must be avoided or protected. Barriers may either be tapered such that barrier ends are located outside the roadway clear zone or be adequately protected with an appropriate form of end treatment described below minimizing any potential hazard. 

The lateral displacement during collisions is typically greatest with ballast-filled barriers and least with concrete barriers. 

Barriers must conform to the following specifications:

Reflectorized Impact Recovery System Devices \(End Treatments\)

Placement and selection of end treatments are to be designed and sealed by a qualified Professional Engineer registered with Engineers Geoscientists Manitoba using AASHTO Roadside Design Guide, 4th Edition. Devices must conform to NCHRP \(National Cooperative Highway Research Program\) Test Level 3 or MASH \(Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware\) and must be non-gating and redirective. 

Any deviation from this standard must be accompanied by a written justification by a Professional Engineer. Drawings sealed by a Professional Engineer detailing the placement and selection of end treatments should be attached to the lane closure request **at least two \(2\) weeks prior** to the proposed installation date with an accompanying message in the Lane Closure App notifying Traffic Management of the attachment. 

Examples of two crash cushion style end treatments are shown below.

***5.02.07 Pedestrian Traffic Control Devices***

When pedestrians are not removed from a work area, a temporary pedestrian path must be maintained where possible. The temporary pedestrian path must be accessible and separated from vehicle traffic. 

Temporary Curb Ramps

Temporary curb ramps maintain accessibility for people with mobility issues by allowing pedestrians to safely traverse a curb. Temporary curb ramps must be stable, with a hard non-slip surface and a slope of 12:1 \(8%\) or less. Prefabricated or asphalt curb ramps should be used. Placement or construction of curb ramps must not block runoff drainage. See examples of pre-fabricated curb ramps below.

Pedestrian Channelization Devices

Pedestrian channelization devices \(PCDs\) provide a clear delineated path for pedestrians through a work area. It is important that PCDs are sturdy, have smooth edges, and have continuous top and bottom surfaces. Pedestrian channelization devices should not be used to delineate vehicle traffic, and channelization barrels or tall cones must still be used between a live traffic lane and the pedestrian path. Examples of PCDs are shown below.

Covered Walkways

Covered walkways can be used in or adjacent to work areas to protect pedestrians from overhead hazards. They can be used over existing sidewalks or along temporary pedestrian paths in the roadway. Covered walkways must provide the following features in addition to those described in the 2010 National Building Codes and the 2016 Manitoba Workplace Safety and Health Act and Regulation \(Sections 20.2 to 20.4\); 

• 

Clear width of 1830mm

Temporary Rumble Strips

Temporary rumble strips are used to alert drivers to a changing roadway environment. They act as a form of tactile stimuli that can be used at the start of DCZs as a supplement to the provincially regulated signage. Research has shown that temporary rumble strips can result in small decreases in speed and provide tactile and auditory feedback that increases driver alertness. Their use at the start of reduced speed zones in DCZs would further alert drivers to pay attention to their driving environment. 

There are many types of temporary rumble strips, with each type having its own installation guidelines. 

A construction agency must submit drawings detailing the selection and placement of rumble strips to the Traffic Management Branch for review and approval if they wish to implement temporary rumble strips as part of their work zone. 

Snow Fencing

Orange plastic snow fencing can be installed and maintained on any perimeter side of a construction project site where there is a risk to the safety and health of a person travelling whether by walking or by vehicle immediately adjacent to the site. Orange plastic snow fencing must be a minimum 1 metre in height.

**MOBILE AND VERY SHORT DURATION WORK ZONES**

**\(Figure 41\)**

Figure 39 depicts vehicles suitably equipped to act as traffic control vehicles for mobile and very short duration work zones \(work zones that move continuously or intermittently stopping at a fixed location for up to 30 minutes\). The devices shall conform to the requirement of Section 5 and shall be kept clean and in proper working order and the following conditions must prevail: 1. The blockage shall not exceed 30 minutes duration or occur during peak periods. 

2. Only one lane is closed at any one time and there must be at least one other lane available for that direction of travel. 

3. A buffer vehicle equipped with a flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device must be used where visibility of the work zone is limited by horizontal or vertical curves \(example: bridges, overpasses or underpasses\). The buffer vehicle should be located at the most visible location available. The table below provides guidance as to appropriate separation distances between the buffer vehicle and the work area.

4. On streets with a posted speed limit of 70, 80 or 90 km/h, a flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device is required. 

5. A flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device is required at night. 

6. The flashing or sequential arrow traffic control device must be turned off when traffic control is no longer required or when the vehicle is being moved from one work zone to another. 

7. Truck or trailer mounted impact attenuators \(also known as crash cushions\) are recommended for the first vehicle or trailer in a mobile or very short duration setup on a roadway with a posted speed limit of 70, 80 or 90 km/h. 

8. The minimum requirement for streets with 50 km/h or 60 km/h speed limits are:

• Two flashing amber beacons at least 2.0 m from ground level. 

• Orange and black reflectorized hazard panel with a minimum dimension of 2.0 m by 0.5 m at least 1.0 m from ground level. 

• Two 600 mm x 750 mm reflectorized black on white “Keep Right” \(RB-25\) and/or “Keep Left” 

\(RB-25L\) regulatory signs. 

• Where it is possible to pass on the right, a “Keep Right” sign shall be used. Where it is possible to pass on the left, a “Keep Left” sign shall be used. Where it is possible to pass on either the right or the left, a “Keep Right” and a “Keep Left” sign shall be used. The “Keep Right” and/or “Keep Left” signs mounted on the vehicle must not be visible to motorists when not in use.

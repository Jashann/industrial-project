    Simple k-NN Model Evaluation Results:
    ------------------------------------
    Model type: k-Nearest Neighbors (k=5)
    Features: Angular relationships between work area points
    Mean Circular Error: 4.51 degrees
    Median Circular Error: 3.80 degrees
    
    This means the model can predict the construction rotation
    with an average error of 4.51 degrees.

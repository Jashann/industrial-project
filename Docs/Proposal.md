# Proposal for AI-Powered Construction Zone

# Planning Tool

**Project Title** : AI-Assisted Construction Zone Planning Tool for Winnipeg Regulations

**Prepared by** : Nhat Nam Tran, Jashanjot Gill
**Date** : December 21st, 2024
**Course** : COMP 4560 – Industrial Project
**Supervisor** : Aden Knelsen-Dobson

## Part 1: Abstract

The proposed project involves developing an AI-powered tool designed to aid in the planning
and layout of construction zones. Targeting compliance with Winnipeg’s specific rules and
regulations, this system provides users with an AI assistant that will automate the final initial
layout by analyzing the selected map area and pre-filling necessary details such as pylon
placements, signage distances, and workplace boundaries. This tool aims to standardize the
planning processes and enhance safety while maintaining high accuracy and regulatory
compliance.

## Part 2: Background

Our team is well-prepared to execute this project based on prior academic and practical
experiences:

- **Courses** : Courses such as Artificial Intelligence, Software Development, and Human-
  Computer Interaction provide the foundational knowledge required for developing this
  tool.
- **Previous Experience** : Experience in building software systems, familiarity with GIS
  mapping tools, and an understanding of AI model deployment armed us with the
  necessary skills to tackle this challenge.
- **Skills to Learn** : Advanced AI integration, compliance mapping for municipal
  regulations, and optimization of user interface design.

## Part 3: Problem Statement

Planning construction zones manually is time-consuming, error-prone, and demands thorough
knowledge of local regulations. The industry faces challenges in ensuring compliance with
Winnipeg’s rules regarding pylon placement, signage, and worksite layouts, often requiring
iterations and significant oversight.

The goal of this project is to create an intuitive, AI-powered tool that:

1. Provides an interactive design interface for mapping construction zones.
2. Automates regulatory compliance through AI-generated layouts.
3. Reduces planning time and increases accuracy, making it valuable to city planners,
   construction firms, and regulatory bodies.

## Part 4: Methodology and Timeline

### Methodology

1. **Research and Analysis** : Study Winnipeg’s construction zone regulations and design
   industry standards.
2. **Design and Development** :
   o Develop a user interface inspired by design tools like Photoshop.
   o Integrate map data (e.g., Google Maps API).
   o Implement AI models for compliance checking and autofill functionality.
3. **Testing** :
   o Validate AI outputs against Winnipeg’s standards.
   o Conduct usability testing with Avalyn and industry professionals.
4. **Refinement and Deployment** :
   o Incorporate feedback to refine features.
   o Prepare a final presentation and deploy a prototype.

### Timeline

```

## Part 5: Infrastructure, Facilities, and Expert Personnel

## Required

### Infrastructure and Facilities

- **Software** : Access to development tools (e.g., Python, TensorFlow, GIS software),
  Google Maps API.
- **Hardware** : High-performance computers for AI model training and testing.

### Personnel

- **Team Members** : Developers with AI, GIS, and software design experience.
- **External Collaboration** : Possible collaboration with city planning experts and
  construction firms for regulation validation and feedback, we were hoping Avalyn could
  help us with this.

## Part 6: Outcome and Deliverables

### Expected Outcomes

1. A functional prototype of the AI-powered planning tool.
2. Documentation of compliance with Winnipeg’s regulations.
3. A presentation summarizing the tool’s features, challenges, and future applications.

### Deliverables

- **Minimum Deliverable** : Fully functional AI that provides accurate layout automation.
- **Stretch Goals** : A working interface with manual design tools, potentially support for
  additional regions’ regulations, and enhanced UI features.
